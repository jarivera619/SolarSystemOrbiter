# SolarSystemOrbiter
First crack at a fun project for Astrodynamics. 
I'm going through the Fundamentals of Astrodynamics by Bate, Mueller, White and Saylor and also the video lectures from UF. 
I wanted to make a playground for an orbiter to make a 6DOF sim with a control system and a halfway decent simulation of a spacecraft.

Right now it exists as two files.
getGravityForces contains the classes and fxns for space objects and spacecraft. 
tryingToMake6DOF contains the bulk of the fxns to actually run the 6DOF. Basically a main.cpp analog.
